# Timo

Timo is a small application commissioned for me as a recruitment task by Nextrope. The purpose of the application is to use TypeScript and any HTTP application framework to create a solution that will allow us to track time and generate reports on how much time we spent working on a given day.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `node@16.13.2`
- `yarn@1.22.15`
- `npm@8.3.0`

### Installation

The installation process is trivial, just install the packages using `yarn` or `npm`. 

```bash
$ yarn
```

If you are preparing an application for production you should build it and use JavaScript code that has been transpiled from the source code.

```bash
$ yarn build
```

### Usage

If you plan to use the app on your machine, it is recommended that you use the `yarn dev` command, this will open a local development environment and allow you to live preview your changes.

```bash
$ yarn dev
```
