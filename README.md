# Timo

Timo is a small application commissioned for me as a recruitment task by Nextrope. The purpose of the application is to use TypeScript and any HTTP application framework to create a solution that will allow us to track time and generate reports on how much time we spent working on a given day.

# About

## Project Reqiurements
Write a time tracking application. Application should have following functionalities:
 - starting the working time with a description of what the user is currently working on (remember to block the possibility of starting a new time when the previous one has not been stopped).
 - Stopping the working time.
 - downloading total working time in a data format that allows for easy display on a chart broken down by day.

### Technical Reqiurements
 - Implementation in any framework (preferred loopback.io version 4 or others e.g.: express.js, nest.js)
 - Implementation in TypeScript language
 - Tests implementation
 - Endpoint description in OpenAPI standard


## Getting Started

> If you know a little bit of node itâ€™s a piece of cake

### Prerequisites

- `node@16.13.2`
- `yarn@1.22.15`
- `npm@8.3.0`

### Installation

The installation process is trivial, just install the packages using `yarn` or `npm`. 

```bash
$ yarn
```

If you are preparing an application for production you should build it and use JavaScript code that has been transpiled from the source code.

```bash
$ yarn build
```

### Usage

If you plan to use the app on your machine, it is recommended that you use the `yarn dev` command, this will open a local development environment and allow you to live preview your changes. On the other hand, if you just want to test the application I recommend using the button below, it will allow you to fork the documentation from Postman and test the endpoints from a Heroku hosted application.If you don't want to use postman we also have [statically hosted documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12555920/UVXqECdy).

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/12555920-c109196b-184b-4d91-86d8-0216b6026771?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D12555920-c109196b-184b-4d91-86d8-0216b6026771%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dfe2749bd-17c3-4e9f-95e3-69ce48ec9978)

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

To test your application through unit tests created in `ava` you can use the following command, the command `test:cov` will also return code coverage. The badge below shows the current code coverage.

```sh
$ yarn test
$ yarn test:cov
```
